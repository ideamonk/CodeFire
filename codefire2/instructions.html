<ul>
  <li>Work environment is linux based gcc/g++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Stick to the input/output specification as defined by the problem.</li>
  <li>Your programs should read the inputs in same order as the problem mentions</li>
  <li>Remember, the programs you submit are autocompiled and tested with judge inputs automatically. So, you can appreciate how important it is to stick by the order &amp; number of inputs/outputs</li>
  <li>Once done, always test your code with sample input outputs given in the problem</li>
  <li>All problems have different points, if you try a problem again after getting a wrong answer flag from judge, you will get a lesser percentage of total points.</li>
  <li>Keep checking out the My Submissions link for status of the code you submitted.</li>
  <li>Rankings can be seen from the Stats link on top</li>
  <li>You can either copy-paste the code into submission box or you can even browse-upload your c/c++ source file</li>
