PREFACE
--------
Well, we have seen a lot of people who know one or the other programming languages.
We can see them all over India. You can find so many people taking C/C++ courses,
yet another huge lot taking up Java courses. Do you think merely joining such courses
or learning what is done in the B.Tech syllabus, is enough to solve real world problems?
You might have seen what a structure is in C/C++ but, you never came to see how it
can help simplify complicated problems of reality. You might have learnt sorting
algorithms, but how many time you have used it to do something other than solving
the test paper ? What point I'm trying to bring out is that, something is lacking
in the learning process. Its the 'Application' of what we have learnt.
And CodeFire my friends, is the platform where you can come up, show off ur skills,
compete with others, and learn more better ways to fulfill this gap.

What CodeFire aims to do is to create a competitive environment for all those who
would love to be better programmers of the future. CodeFire is open to all, there
is no restriction of branch, year, age etc.

In December 2007, we went for ACM-ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)
Asia round. Our teams got ranks 32 and 36 respectively. Overall 100 teams from all
over India and Asia participated. We think we can do a lot better! And CodeFire
is what is gonna help us create the very best teams out of our institution
to be sent to such contests....



INSTALLATION WORKAROUND
------------------------

Im documenting it as I install it on a winXP vm

1. Download XAMPP - http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.7.0.zip
2. Extract it in a folder called "xampp" on root of any drive that has enough space.
3. Now the xampp folder should have folders like 'mysql', 'htdocs' etc
4. in htdocs you place websites etc
5. the mysql folder has a folder - 'data' thats where the database lies in form of files n folders
6. Now you need to clean the htdocs folder
7. Make a folder called 'xampp' inside htdocs folder
8. shift all the contents from htdoct to htdocs/xampp (ofcourse excluding the newly makde htdocs/xampp)
9. That folder contains crucial part of xampp configuration, in cases of emergency it would be useful
10. Basically the phpMyAdmin , the web interface for DB management is khulla open as "http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/" so beware of people who know xampp or are too clever. Theres no password on that page. Password changing is a lil screwd up, we're used same username "root" with no pass to create the database. changing root password would screw stuff.
11. So, that url shudn't be seen by any friend, foe or fucker :P.. same goes for this mail

12. extract codefire2.rar into your htdocs folder.
13. Now htdocs folder should contain files like reg.php, tuts.php etc.
14. and http://127.0.0.1/ should show up codefire logo etc
15. Download a devcpp portable edition from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=190331&package_id=223332&release_id=502572

16. Bring this paf.exe crap into htdocs/codetemp folder
17. double click it, and hit install/extract without much thoughts.
18. Now you should have a new folder in htdocs/codetemp folder with some name
19. whatever name it has rename/make sure it is = "Dev-CppPortable"
20. Download/get a latest copy of devcpp installer
21. place it in htdocs folder
22. Make sure/rename it to "devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe" no matter what its name is.

23. Now you gotta put the data
24. goto xampp/mysql/data folder
25. extract mainbank.rar there
26. now you should have xampp/mysql/data/mainbank folder which should have some files like db.opt etc.

27. Now in the xampp foder run xampp_control.exe, it would sit in tray
28. bring it up and tick svc infront of apache
29. run apache and mysql... make sure both are green  n running
30. Now test codefire as http://127.0.0.1/
31. ideamonk is already registererd

32. Adminning the codefire -
33. goto http://127.0.0.1/admin.php to get a login
34. username codeadmin password binaryfire
35. Play with the interface.
36. type of problem won't work, we removed it for icpc contest and i don't know if i commented or deleted the code
37. Keep clicking list submissions when contest goes on to qualify/fuck peopl
38. test the compilation before implementing it... make sure you do.

39. Now when putting it up in lab/etc just copy paste the whole xampp thing there
40. test it again... and have fun.

I guess that's all, hopefully...

when people complain that their code isnt getting submitted properly,
as d admin, browse to http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin
select the db called mainbanl from left
goto a table called subm, checkout the code column for that guy whose pissing you
copy the whole code
compile n test it in devcpp
judge him/her on that.
make them happy lol

anyways try it.
